### Problem Statement

Dental diseases such as caries, gingivitis, infections, and fractures are often underdiagnosed due to limited access to specialists and the manual effort required to analyze dental X-rays and intraoral images. Traditional diagnosis is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to variability. There is a need for an automated, reliable system that can assist clinicians by accurately detecting dental pathologies from imaging data.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement an end-to-end AI-based dental pathology detection system using computer vision and deep learning. The system aims to identify and localize multiple dental conditions from X-ray and camera images, benchmark multiple object detection models, and provide real-time inference to support faster and more consistent clinical decision-making.
